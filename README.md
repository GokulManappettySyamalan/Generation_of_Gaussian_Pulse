# Generation_of_Gaussian_Pulse


In digital communications, Gaussian Filters are employed in Gaussian Minimum Shift Keying - GMSK and Gaussian Frequency Shift Keying (GFSK). Two dimensional Gaussian filters are used in image processing for producing Gaussian blurs. The impulse response of a Gaussian filter is Gaussian. Gaussian filters give no overshoot with minimal rise and fall time when excited with a step function. Gaussian filter has minimum group delay
